OpenMark is a workflow to distill long AI chats into shareable Markdown.

## How it works
1. Summarize & refine your chat
2. Create a doc from the `_template.md`
3. Commit & open a PR
4. CI checks â†’ auto-deploy

## Start writing
- Use [`docs/_template.md`](./_template.md) as your base
- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug.md`
- Put images in `/static/` and reference relatively

## Contribute
See the repo root `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
